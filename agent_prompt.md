Create a minimal Rust-based Delivery Service for Linux to support a Messaging Layer Security (MLS) messaging app, using OpenMLS (version 0.5) and openmls_rust_crypto (version 0.1). The service must relay MLS key packages and encrypted messages between clients, supporting group messaging for at least two users (extensible to more). Implement the server using tokio (version 1.0) for asynchronous TCP networking, with endpoints to store/fetch KeyPackages and broadcast encrypted MLS messages (e.g., Welcome, Add, Application messages). Use an in-memory HashMap for storing KeyPackages and group state. Ensure cryptographic agility in the OpenMLS configuration to allow future integration of various key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs). Include basic error handling (e.g., log errors to console). Ensure the service runs with cargo run on 127.0.0.1:8080 and includes dependencies in Cargo.toml. Save the main code in src/main.rs. Verify the service runs on Linux by simulating message relaying. Save the project to my GitHub repository krich11/mls-delivery-service, appending to existing README and .gitignore (include target/ and Cargo.lock in .gitignore). Do not overwrite existing repository content.
